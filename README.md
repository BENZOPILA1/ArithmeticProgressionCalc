# ArithmeticProgressionCalc
An arithmetic progression (AP) is a sequence of numbers in which each term after the first is obtained by adding a fixed number to the preceding term. The fixed number is known as the common difference. The sequence of numbers in an AP is denoted by a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d,... where 'a' is the first term and 'd' is the common difference.
